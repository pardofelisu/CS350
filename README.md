projects from CS350

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  -The two projects I have selected are about integrating flashing LEDs on a breadboard, connecting it to a Raspberry Pi, and manipulating the LEDs to flash off and on. Specifically, milestone 1 demonstrates how to fade in and out the LED, while as milestone 3 demonstrates how to display morse code through red and blue LEDs.
2) What did you do particularly well?
  -I believe I did well in actually writing the code, as I have plenty of real-world experience in manipulating and utilizing VS code.
3) Where could you improve?
  -I can improve on explaining my code better through inline comments.
4) What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  -Some resources I am adding into my support network are my coworkers who deal with writing code on the daily. They have a lot more hands on experience than me!
5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  -Some particular skills from this project that are transferable to my other course work is my newfound knowledge on embedded systems, which may prove to be useful when writing code for different systems.
6) How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  -I made this project maintainable by following the given directions in my coursework's guide, which includes different comments in the code and the installation process for the breadboard. I have also followed the general coding guidelines to ensure that the code is readable and adaptable for future usage.
